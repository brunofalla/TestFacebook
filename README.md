# TestFacebook
First automation test on facebook login page<BR>
I will use some of my learning on Udemy Selenium training to get a code that tests the login page of Facebook.
The Test Cases I'm willing to implement are:(using XPATH)
  1)Sucessfull Login
  2)Unsuccessfull Login with non existent email
  3)Unsuccessfull login with wrong password
  4)Navigation (scroll down) and Log off
