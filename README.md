# TestFacebook
First automation test on facebook login page<BR>
I will use some of my learning on Udemy Selenium training to get a code that tests the login page of Facebook.<BR>
The Test Cases I'm willing to implement are:(using XPATH)<BR>
  1)Sucessfull Login<BR>
  2)Unsuccessfull Login with non existent email<BR>
  3)Unsuccessfull login with wrong password<BR>
